** SPED2SQL is a RubyGem to convert SPED tax data files into SQL. SPED2SQL reads the SPED file and matches it against a template in order to convert the data into its corresponding SQL format. You can also make it extensible by creating as many custom parsers as you want and attaching it to the reading process **
